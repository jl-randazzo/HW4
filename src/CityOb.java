/*I'll just put some notes up here. The CityOb is simple: I just used a string for each line and then searched for the commas
 *and assigned the strings between to the values dma, city, state. I originally was trying to implement the comparator and override it
 * as a static method in this class, but I just wasn't able to quite figure it out. I'm going to need to work on that a bit more.
 * For the time being I just created another class called CityComparator.java that used the return values of the methods
 * below to compare two CityOb's. And obviously the toString method is what I used to write the final file.
